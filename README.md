Tool to summarize and track Bills and Motions in the Canadian Parliament

Intent is to use Public Open Data from Canadian Parliament to track bills and motions in the Parliament of Canada. This may expand to do the same for provincial government tracking. If possible, a municiple tracker may be implemented in future.

Canadian political action and laws can be difficult to track and find source data unless using directly the Parliament of Canada website, which can be difficult to navigate. The goal is to grab updates, new motions and bills, and track how members of parliament and Senate vote on bills, their party affiliations, and a concise summary of the item to quickly stay up to date on the state of canadian politics.
